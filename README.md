# `Turborepo Starter`

This is a starter I built combining the power of Turborepo, Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS 4.0, and Shadcn/ui. Itâ€™s designed to help you kickstart a modern monorepo setup quickly and efficiently.

## What's Included?
This Turborepo starter comes with the following apps and packages:

### Apps and Packages
- docs: A basic Vite app with React and TypeScript, perfect for documentation.
- web: The main Vite app with React and TypeScript.
- @repo/ui: A shared component and utility library built with Shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS 4.0.
- @repo/eslint-config: Shared ESLint configurations for consistent code quality.
- @repo/typescript-config: Shared tsconfig.json configurations used across all apps and packages.

All code is written entirely in TypeScript.

## Preconfigured Tools
This starter includes several tools already set up for you:

- TypeScript for static type checking.
- ESLint for linting and maintaining code quality.
